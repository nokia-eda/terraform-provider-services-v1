<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) name of the Router
- `namespace` (String) the namespace scope in which to operate

### Optional

- `hash` (String) resource content will be returned as it was at the time of this git hash
- `spec` (Attributes) The Router enables the configuration and management of routing functions within a network. This resource allows for setting a unique Router ID, configuring VNIs and EVIs with options for automatic allocation, and defining import and export route targets. It also includes advanced configuration options such as BGP settings, including autonomous system numbers, AFI/SAFI options, and route advertisement preferences. Node selectors can be used to constrain the deployment of the router to specific nodes within the network. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String)
- `kind` (String)
- `metadata` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `status` (Attributes) RouterStatus defines the observed state of Router (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status))
