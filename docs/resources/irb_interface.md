It also supports advanced features such as BFD configuration, Virtual IP discovery, and ARP/ND-related settings like Proxy ARP/ND and EVPN route advertisement. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

- `name` (String) name of the IRBInterface
- `namespace` (String) the namespace scope in which to operate
- `status` (Attributes) IRBInterfaceStatus defines the observed state of IRBInterface (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status))
