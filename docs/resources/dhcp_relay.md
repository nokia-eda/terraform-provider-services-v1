<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) The DHCPRelay enables the forwarding of DHCP requests and responses between clients and servers across different networks. This resource allows for the configuration of various DHCP relay sub-options, such as CircuitID, RemoteID, and ClientLinkLayerAddress, to provide detailed client information. It also includes settings for specifying the router to reach the DHCP server, the list of DHCP servers to forward requests to, and selectors for Routed and IRB interfaces where the relay will be configured. Additionally, the GI Address option can be set to derive the Gateway IP address from the selected interface, ensuring correct routing of DHCP messages. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Optional

- `api_version` (String)
- `kind` (String)
- `name` (String) name of the DHCPRelay
- `namespace` (String) the namespace scope in which to operate
- `status` (Attributes) DHCPRelayStatus defines the observed state of DHCPRelay (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status))
