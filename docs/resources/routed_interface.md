<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `metadata` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `spec` (Attributes) The RoutedInterface enables the configuration and management of Layer 3 interfaces for routing traffic between different networks. This resource allows for specifying an underlying Interface and Router, configuring VLAN IDs, and setting the IP MTU. It also supports the learning of unsolicited ARPs, defining both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and enabling unnumbered interfaces. Advanced features such as BFD configuration, Proxy ARP/ND, and ARP timeout settings are included to ensure robust and efficient routing. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Optional

- `api_version` (String)
- `kind` (String)
- `name` (String) name of the RoutedInterface
- `namespace` (String) the namespace scope in which to operate
- `status` (Attributes) RoutedInterfaceStatus defines the observed state of RoutedInterface (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--status))

If IPv6 is specified, no IP address are configured on the sub-interface and only the link local address will be used.  If any IP addresses are specified for either IPv4 or IPv6 that will take precedence and IPs will be assigned to the interfaces. (Deprecated, Use IPv6RouterAdvertisement)
